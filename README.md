# Shape Calculator in C++

## About
This project is a simple C++ application that demonstrates the use of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles to calculate the area and perimeter of various shapes. It was my first program and serves as a practical introduction to applying OOP concepts in C++.

## Features
- Calculation of the area and perimeter for different shapes.
- Supported shapes include Circle, Rectangle, Square (extendable to more shapes).
- Demonstrates the use of classes, inheritance, and polymorphism in C++.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- A C++ compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang, MSVC)
- Basic knowledge of C++ and OOP concepts

### Installation
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/fsher1282/Shape-Calculator
   ```
